 ## Website Requirements

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A landing page containing:

    * An explanation of the project.
    * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.*


* Four visualization pages, each with:

    * A descriptive title and heading tag.
    * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
    * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


* A "Comparisons" page that:

    * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
    * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

        * The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.




* A "Data" page that:

    * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

        * The table must be a bootstrap table component. Hint

        * The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. 


* The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

    * Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
    * Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
    * Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
    * Is responsive (using media queries).
